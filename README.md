To build the program -

1.  Clone the repository
2.  run: `cargo run -- <Port number>`
    For example - `cargo run -- localhost:8080`

There are 2 ways to use the client globally from the cli -

1.  Download the prebuilt binary from the releases tab and add it to the Path [paste it in C:\Windows\System32]
2.  If the above method does not work, build the project on your machine, copy tcp.exe from target/release and paste it in C:\Windows\System32.
